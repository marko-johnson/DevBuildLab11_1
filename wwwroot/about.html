            I was born and raised on the eastside of Detroit, Michigan.  When I was a kid, we moved around alot which caused my twin brother and I to attend multiple elementary schools.  By the time we made it to middle school,
            we had already attended 4 different elementary schools.  The good thing is, we only attended one middle school and one high school.  I attended Foch Middle School on Detroit's eastside from 9/1996 thru 6/1999.
            From there I attended Lewis Cass Technical High School and graduated with endorsed electronics technology diploma in 6/2003.  I worked as an intern for the Detroit Water and Sewerage information technology department
            while I was still in high school.  I did some college in 2004 at Henry Ford Community College and thought I wanted to be an electrician and eventually dropped out after a year.  I got laid off as an intern for the City
            of Detroit in 5/2006.  After this, I worked as a direct care worker and assisted individuals with special needs for 10 years.  I also worked as a peronal trainer and eventually managed a Fitness USA gym in 2007.
            In 2016, I went back to school and earned my associate's degree in information technology with specialization in programming in 5/2019.
