        <p>
            I love music.  I can go without watching television or movies.  However, I don't believe i can go without listening to music.  I listen to music everyday.
            My favorite genres are R&B, rap, hip hop, afrobeats, jazz, classical, and many more.  When I'm not working, you'll find me listening to music.

        </p>

        <p>
            My favorite artists are Michael Jackson, Prince, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston.  Those artist did very well in the 80s.
            My favorite artists that are still on top of their game are Jay-Z, Beyonce, Drake, Bruno Mars, The Weeknd and many many more.  My favorite song of all time is "Human Nature" by Michael Jackson.

        <p>
            I was born and raised on the eastside of Detroit, Michigan.  When I was a kid, we moved around alot which caused my twin brother and I to attend multiple elementary schools.  By the time we made it to middle school,
            we had already attended 4 different elementary schools.  The good thing is, we only attended one middle school and one high school.

        <p>
            I started my IT journey back in 2015.  My career goal was to be a software engineer.  I started working at Time Warner Cable as a customer support professional and basically provided assistance
            with billing and also troubleshooted their internet and cable services.  This job provided me with great troubleshooting skills I needed to work in the field of information technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            With those new troubleshooting skills,  I went online and studied things I would need to know for troubleshooting a PC.  Then I finally had the courage to apply to a service desk job and was
            hired as a service desk analyst for Stefanini.  This posistion added more skills to my plate in regards of troubleshooting OS (i.e. Windows 7, Windows 10, OS X 10.11 El Capitan, etc).
            I also learned alot about active directory (i.e. giving access, removing access, resetting passwords, etc.).  While progressing at Stefanini, I began pursuing my associate's degree in computer science
            (with a speciailization in computer programming) at Macomb Community College full time.
        </p>

        <p>
            After a grueling interview in 2017, I was selected to to began my new path with Ascension Technologies as a service desk analyst.  One thing stuck out to me from this interview was the question,
            "Where do I see myself in 5 years?"  I told the interviewer that I see myself being a software engineer in 5 years.This job provided tuition reiumbursement for a few semesters which was great for my career.
            After almost 4 years at Ascension Technologies, I felt that this was my time to resign from my current postion and pursue a role that would put in the pathway of becoming a software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is when I started applying to a bunch of postions but had no luck until I received a call back from Nexsys Technologies to interview for their application support analyst role.
            This was a 45 minute panel interview via Microsoft Teams (due to the pandemic) which went great and I was selected for the role.  After several months of working in this role, an opportunity with Quicken Loans/Rocket Mortgage presented itself for me to finally
            get my foot in the door as a software engineer.  This was the DevBuild program which, I had to attend the required workshops and then pass an assessment to be considered for the program.  Unfortunately, I failed
            the assessment the first time.  I felt defeated. Then I told myself to not worry about it and to try again after doing more self-study.  I applied again, took the assessment, and interviewed twice.  After all of the hardwork and prayer,
            currently, my response to "Where do I see myself in 5 years?" to my previous manager at Ascension is coming to pass.
